# News Site

The assignment is to create a responsive news site, using flexbox and/or CSS-grid.

## The problem

I started with the website layout sketch on paper and then continued with the structure in html. The process started well, but then, since I didn't sketch the design (just the layout), it continued quite chaotically. Because I hadn't figured out what the website would look like. 

Regarding styling, I used mostly flexbox for making layout. I struggled for many times when trying to arrange the content. In most of the cases I had the problem with not having proper end </tags>. So I started to make visible borders and it helped to understand that something is not right. Maybe you can suggest a better way how to notice these kinds of problems in the very beginning? And I also struggled with images, how to make them look good in responsive design and also how to make flex children fit in the width of flex parent. I asked these questions on Slack and I got very good answers which helped.

If I had more time I would have:
    1.) made my hamburger menu clickable;
    2.) played around with CSS-grid more to get to know it better. Because in this project my focus was on flexbox;

All in all I am very happy with the result and I am really proud of what I did in such a short time.

My aim for the next project is to start it by creating a design using Figma. And try to be more organized when writing the code. Do it step by step, feature by feature, not chaotically there and here. And also make push commits in a more organized way.
